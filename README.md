# Offline-Search-Engine
An offline search engine using NLTK and Python
Why we need it 
--------------
One of the main problem i faced while starting my new project was choose the right research paper.
Because there are plenty research paper available and after reading we will realised that we just moved out of track.And IEEE papers and only available in university wifi in my case so I had to download as much as I could and go through it.

So I thought if I could create a search engine that pop out the most relevent file from a bulk of offline files

Regarding My project
1.As a initial stage I just only considered text files 
2.if you provide a search query the word will be searched the whole offline files and pop out the file that contain the higher frequency of the given file
3.As a next step I included that The first five word which occured most frequently in the result file will be show as the suggessions for the next search
